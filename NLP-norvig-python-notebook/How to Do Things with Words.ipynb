It seems that is too strict; there must be some \"real\" words that are not in our dictionary, so we shouldn't give them probability zero.  There is also a question of likelyhood of being a \"real\" word.  It does seem that \"neverbeforeseen\" is more English-like than \"zqbhjhsyefvvjqc\", and so perhaps should have a higher probability.\n",
